      <p>Albert Einstein became a pop icon of science thanks to his genius at self- marketing. His professional approach to marketing himself to the press, radio and film established him as an unmistakable brand. Einstein himself wrote in a 1920 letter: “Just as everything he touched turned into gold for the man in the fairy tale—so for me everything turns into a fuss in the newspapers.”</p> -Rainer Zitelmann, <cite>Forbes</cite>
